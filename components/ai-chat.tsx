â€¢ You're doing great with your respiratory health!

**Keep it up by:**
â€¢ Staying active and keeping those lungs working

â€¢ Lower confidence may indicate test conditions weren't optimal
â€¢ Consider retaking the test in a quiet environment

â€¢ It might be worth getting a professional opinion

**What I'd suggest:**
â€¢ Maybe chat with a healthcare provider in the next week or two
